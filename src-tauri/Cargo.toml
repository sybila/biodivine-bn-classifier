[features]

# by default Tauri runs in production mode
# when `tauri dev` runs it is executed with `cargo run --no-default-features` if `devPath` is an URL
default = [ "custom-protocol" ]

# this feature is used for production builds where `devPath` points to the filesystem
# DO NOT remove this
custom-protocol = [ "tauri/custom-protocol" ]

# For releases, we want to include Z3 statically, so that users
# don't have to install it (or break compatibility with new versions).
# So for CI builds, this feature is enabled, but for local builds,
# you don't need it as long as you have Z3 installed (because your
# build may take >30min if you enable it).
