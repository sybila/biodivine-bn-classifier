Collection of several large models used for tool evaluation.

We use the same 4 properties to run classification procedure on each model. 
These properties are listed as plaintext in `properties-only.txt` for convenience.

Subdirectories contain files regarding each tested model.
- model annotated with properties (input for the classifier) `model-parametrized-annotated.aeon`
- for most models we also include non-parametrized and non-annotated version of the model `model-fixed.aeon`
- classification result bundle `model-results.zip`
